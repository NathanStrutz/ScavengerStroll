      <h2>Information about FLL team The Quad Pod</h2>
      <p>We are an FLL (FIRST Lego League) team, number 50751, The Quad Pod. Each year for FLL we build a robot, solve missions, and come up with a solution to a challenge. The 2020-2021 FIRST FLL season, <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll">RePLAY</a>, challenges all teams to create a project that gets people outside and more active.
        Our project is called Scavenger Stroll (the website you are on now), and its purpose is to help people enjoy being outside and more active by looking for items on the scavenger list.
